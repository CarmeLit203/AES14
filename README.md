The System is a Java Based Client-Server program that will create better exam taking experience for students. it communicates with a premade MySQL database, and is able to:
  - Create a questions (made by teachers) and exams collections.
  - Test the students with the exams.
  - Check the exams submitted by students
  - Create and display statistical data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 
First, create the database by running the test.sql script on your mysql server. This will create a database named 'test', and fill it with mock data.
Next, clone this repository and build with your IDE of choice.
Finally, you can run the server-side by running server.control.Server.main() run configuration.
The client-side is ran by client.control.start.main(). 

### Prerequisites

You will need a JDK that supports JavaFX to run the GUI application and a mysql-connector library for java.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
